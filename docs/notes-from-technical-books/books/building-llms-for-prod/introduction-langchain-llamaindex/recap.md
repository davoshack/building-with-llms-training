# Recap

This chapter introduced several frameworks that simplify the development of LLM-powered applications: LangChain, LlamaIndex, and OpenAI’s Assistants API.

LangChain provides abstractions for integrating data sources, tools, and LLMs, offering a useful framework for prompt management, retrieval, embeddings, and indexing. We showed its capabilities by creating a multilingual news articles summarizer using GPT-4.

LlamaIndex also simplifies the creation of LLM-powered apps and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, focusing on information indexing and retrieval through its vector store, data connectors, nodes, indexing, and query engine.

OpenAI’s Assistants API enables developers to create AI assistants more easily. It offers a Code Interpreter for running Python code, Knowledge Retrieval for searching uploaded documents, and Function Calling for adding custom functions or tools.

These frameworks and APIs provide developers with various options for creating LLM-powered applications, each with its own strengths and focus areas. They make it easier to integrate LLMs and create powerful, AI-driven solutions.
